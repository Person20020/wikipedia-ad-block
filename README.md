# wikipedia-ad-block
This is a browser extension that removes the donation ad at the top of Wikipedia pages along with the popups at the bottom of your screen.  
It works on both Chromium based browsers and Firefox but there is not yet a signed version for Firefox so if you want to use this, you will have to install it from the debugging section and reinstall it whenever Firefox is restarted. As usual, the donation banners have been hidden since it is the beginning of the year so I haven't been able to fully test the extension.

## Installation
### Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera)
1. Download and unzip the zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Person20020/wikipedia-ad-block/releases/latest). Put the folder somewhere safe where you won't move or delete it later. It must stay in the same place after installation or the browser won't be able to find it.
2. Go to your browser's extension page. (Chrome: (chrome://extensions), Brave: (brave://extensions) Edge: (edge://extensions), Opera: Click the extensions button in the bar and choose "Manage extensions...")
3. Enable developer mode. In Chrome, Brave, and Opera, there is a toggle switch in the top right corner of the page. In Edge, there is a toggle switch in the side bar on the left.
4. Load the extension. At the top of the page, click the "Load Unpacked" button and choose the folder that you unzipped earlier.


### Firefox (No signed version. Only temporary install is currently available. The extension will disappear when Firefox is restarted.)
1. Download wikipedia-ad-block.zip. Put it somewhere that you won't move it or delete it later. It must stay in the same place after installation or the browser won't be able to find it.
2. Go to the debugging page and go to "This Firefox." (about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox).
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on...".
5. Choose the wikipedia-ad-block.zip file that was downloaded earlier.
