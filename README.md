# wikipedia-ad-block
This is a browser extension that removes the donation ad at the top of Wikipedia pages along with the popups at the bottom of your screen.  
It currently works on Chromium based browsers and should be ready for Firefox soon (maybe). At the moment the donation banners aren't showing for me on Wikipedia so I haven't been able to fully test the extension.
